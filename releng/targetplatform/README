This folder contains the Target Definition files used within Eclipse
for developing Gyrex.

The same target definition is also used in the Maven build to compile
Gyrex and build its artifacts.

Hint: You should open the "gyrex-target-platform.target" file once and
export it to a folder "gyrex-dev-exported" (within this folder). Then you
can use the "gyrex-target-platform-local.target" file which uses the exported
artifacts and doesn't require an Internet connection to load properly.
