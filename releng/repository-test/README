This test project is a small test to verify that 
the generated product can be installed all by itself 
from the generated repository, i.e. that 
the repository is complete and self-contained.

Note, this must be executed in a separate reactor. Additionally,
the repository must have been build first.

For best results, this should be run with:

  mvn -Dtycho.localArtifacts=ignore clean verify
